# APIUserBundle

This bundle is based on *FOSUserBundle* services but instead of using twig it provides services to build REST APIs to handle common tasks as user registration, forgot password and resetting password.

Included features:
- Easy integration with API Platform and Lexik JWT Authentication bundle.
- Unit tests.
